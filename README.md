# ReactToMyPortfolio

## Description

This motivation for this project was to create a profile that I could send out to possible employers while seeking a job.
This was a great project to work on as one of my first projects was a profile page.
This allowed the program to come full circle and allow me to use skils I have learned throughout mhy coding journey.
This solved the problem of needing to have a profile with information about me, my projets, and a way to contact me.
I learned how to use React and work with the different components. I also used useState, vite, and Netlify.
With this profile, I will be able to house information important to a hiring team.


## Installation

This React profile was built from scratch using React, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Vite, and Netlify
